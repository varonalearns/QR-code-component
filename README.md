## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Beyond putting everything that I have learned about HTML and CSS, I did a little research on how to properly write a git commit message. I still think I need to work on it.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to work on getting better at writing git commit messages. 

### Useful resources

- [How to Write Good Git Commit Messages](https://chiamakaikeanyi.dev/how-to-write-good-git-commit-messages/) - This article helped me to better write git commit messages so that they serve a purpose and make sense for anyone (or myself) looking back on this project.
